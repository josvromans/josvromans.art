Carefully crafted mathematical formulas and logic decide where each next pixel will be drawn.\r\n\r\nThe final result is comprised of multiple layers that can be uncovered with patience.\r\n\r\nPress 'p' to pause or unpause the rendering.\r\n\r\nPress 'r' to render the artwork again. This will toggle between a high-detail render and a fast, low-detail render.\r\n\r\nPress 'v' to render a vertical version of the same artwork.\r\n\r\nWritten in JavaScript", "external_url": "https://www.josvromans.com/work/layers/17", "animation_url": "https://www.josvromans.com/renderer/1100000002000017"}
